# scanlimits

> A tool to examine the behaviour of setuid binaries when constrained.

If you set resource limits using `setrlimit()`, `prlimit()` or the `ulimit`
shell builtin, then those limits apply even across a setuid `execve()`.

To put it another way, any limits you apply to your current shell also apply to
any setuid executables you run. Some developers find this surprising, and it
can introduce vulnerabilities.

Here is an example, the `pam_nologin(8)` module is used to prevent
login if the file `/etc/nologin` exists, so that the system administrator can
temporarily disable login. The code just looks like this:

```c
	fd = open(nologin, O_RDONLY, 0);
	if (fd < 0) {
		login_close(lc);
		return (PAM_SUCCESS);
	}
```

It doesn't check `errno` though, and an unprivileged user can make this return
failure (`EMFILE`, Too many open files) by setting a very low `RLIMIT_NOFILE`
limit.

Therefore, this check can be bypassed if it's required for `su` or similar
authentication.

# Building

Just type `make`, requires `glib2.0`.

# Usage

This tool will attempt to scan for all the different errors that a program
produces when it's constrained. It does that by simply recording the output and
waiting for it to change. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bug, it's up to
you to determine if the error is something security relevant.

Here is an example run, let's see what kind of errors sudo generates when
constrained:

```
$ limits -o output.sh -b filters.txt -- sudo --list --non-interactive
file filters.txt contained 7 valid filter patterns.

	@0x000000000000000001...same
```

Now we should have a shellscript that will print all the different errors
that `limits` found:

```

```

There are lots of errors from the loader, unable to load necessary shared
libraries, these are probably not very interesting.

However, there are a few interesting errors there, `unable to open audit
system`, `unable to initialize PAM`, `no valid sudoers sources found`, `unknown
user: root`, these are worth exploring to see if they might fail open anywhere.

## Options

| Option            | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-t TIMEOUT`      | Kill the process if it takes longer than this (seconds). |
| `-b FILTER`       | Load regex (one per line) to clean output.               |
| `-o OUTPUT`       | Generate a script to see the different outputs found.    |
| `-i INFILE`       | Attach this file to stdin of processes.                  |

### Filters

This tool works by comparing the error messages produced with previous outputs
seen. That only works if error messages are consistent, but some tools like to
put timestamps or pids into errors making them unique.

If the tool you're testing does this, you need to make a filter to explain
how to remove the inconsistent data.

Here is an example, this filter will remove timestamps from glib error
messages:

```
# This is a log timestamp, used by some glib programs.
\d+:\d+:\d+\.\d+:
```

# Examples

Imagine a setuid helper program that updates `/etc/passwd` for you.

```c
    char *buf = read_passwd_file();
    change_user_shell(buf, username, newshell);
    f = fopen("/etc/passwd", "w");
    fwrite(buf, 1, strlen(buf), f);
```

This isn't safe, the user can make that `fwrite()` stop wherever they
want, effectively truncating the file at any boundary they choose. These bugs
can really happen, e.g. CVE-2019-14865


Another example might be programs that parse configuration files, for example
imagine a program that has a configuration file like this:

```
# All users in group staff are allowed.
allow %staff

# Except these users
source users.deny
```

That won't work, because a user can limit the number of files that can be
opened, making the attempt to open the `users.deny` file return `EMFILE`.
